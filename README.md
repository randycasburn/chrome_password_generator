##### Althoug the concept and graphics were gathered from another extension, PassGen Password Generator, the code behind is completely different with minor exceptions.
In the words of that extension: 
> A simple but effective secure password generator for Chrome.

It is!!

The differences between these two extensions are based upon what they do.

1. PassGen
  - Only offers the Icon bar option 
  - Requires no special permissions
2. Plurious (this repository)
  - Offers both the icon bar and context menu options
  - Requires access to web pages in order to provide the context menu option.
  
[I encourage you to check out PassGen from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passgen-password-generato/cfhahkhhdbgkgcpoffcjdiclidcoiaek)

### Developers: The code differences are remarkable and you should check them out. Simply two views of the same problem.
